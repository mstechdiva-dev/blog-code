# Welcome to mstechdiva-code
My approach is simple: kick the tires, break things, figure out why they broke, then share what I learned. You won't find theoretical explanations here. Everything in this repo comes from me building, testing, and, yes, seeing the sunrise more times than I care to count. I will also discuss the evolving build methodology.

I write about what I've actually tried, what worked, what didn't, and the actual setup process.

## What's Coming

As I dive deeper into quantum computing, AI, and emerging technologies with my "kick the tires" approach, you'll find the real code, setup instructions, and experiences from my hands-on exploration.

### Topics I've been exploring in my blog:
- **Quantum Computing** -     Diving deep into Majorana down to Quantum Computing cybersecurity.
- **AI & Machine Learning** - Breaking down complex algorithms and practical applications  
- **Emerging Technologies** - Hands-on exploration of cutting-edge tech concepts
- **Technical Deep Dives** - Real-world experiences with advanced topics

Check out the latest posts at [MsTechDiva.com](https://mstechdiva.com) - not every post will have code, but when I do get hands-on with actual implementation, the code examples will end up here!


## How to Use This Repository

Each folder corresponds to a specific blog post or series of blog posts. You'll find:
- **Clear folder structure** organized by date and topic
- **Detailed comments** explaining each code section
- **Ready-to-run examples** with setup instructions
- **Links back to the original blog post** for full context

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mstechdiva-dev/blog-code.git
   cd blog-code
   ```

2. **Navigate to the topic you're interested in**
   ```bash
   cd posts/2025-03-quantum-computing-basics
   ```

3. **Follow the README in each folder** for specific setup instructions

## My "Kick the Tires" Method

I can't write about anything successfully if I haven't tried it myself. So every post on [MsTechDiva.com](https://mstechdiva.com) starts with me:

- Setting up the actual environment (and sharing the real setup code)
- Running the examples until they work
- Breaking them in interesting ways
- Documenting what I learned from the experience

You get my setup instructions, sample projects, but most importantly, the real experience of what it's like to work with these technologies. Some of it will be a refresh, while others will                                    be completely new.
